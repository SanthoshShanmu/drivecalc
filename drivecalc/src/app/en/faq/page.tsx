            <h2>How does DriveCalc calculate fuel costs?</h2>
            <p>
              We use average fuel consumption for different vehicle types and combine this with updated fuel prices 
              from Norwegian gas stations. For electric cars, we calculate power consumption based on average kWh prices.
            </p>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h2>Are all toll stations in Norway included in the calculations?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, we use updated data from Norwegian toll companies to include all toll stations along the chosen route. 
              We also take into account discounts for different vehicle types and times of day.
            </p>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h2>Do I get a discount on toll fees with an electric car?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, electric cars have reduced rates at most toll stations in Norway. 
              This is included automatically in DriveCalc when you select &quot;electric&quot; as the vehicle type.
            </p>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h2>How accurate are the cost calculations?</h2>
            <p>
              We strive for maximum accuracy by using real-time data for fuel prices and toll fees. 
              Please note that actual fuel consumption may vary based on driving style, weather and traffic conditions.

            <h2>Why do toll fees vary in Norway?</h2>
            <p>
              Toll fees in Norway can vary based on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Vehicle type (electric, hybrid, diesel, petrol)</li>
              <li>Time (rush hour fees in larger cities)</li>
              <li>AutoPASS tag (often gives discount)</li>
              <li>Region and road project (different prices in different parts of the country)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              DriveCalc takes these factors into account in our calculations.

              We update fuel prices in real-time based on data from the largest gas station chains in Norway.
